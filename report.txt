In our dataset there are two columns thats is age and cabin having missing values.
cabin has 77% missing values and age has almost 20% missing values.
Initially we cleaned the dataset by removing all rows having null or na as values by using the 
dropna function( df=df.dropna(how='all') , where df is the dataset )
We cleaned the dataset by entirely removing the cabin since 77% values were missing.
We removed passengerId column since it had no use to us in our project.
Also we filled the missing values for age by the technique of interpolation where the null 
values of age is filled by the average values of the adjascent top and bottom age values.
( function used to do that was df.Age=df.Age.interpolate() , where df id the dataset used ) 
We contructed a boxplot for age by which we found outliers and we dropped all the outliers.
keeping 1 as survived and 0 otherwise, we constructed a scatterplot graph age vs survived.
We constructed teo separate graphs that were for men and women where each graph was number 
survivers and people who died vs the age. There were 3 ports that were ports S,C and Q that 
were the boarding points for the passengers.Another graph we visualised based on the port 
where the people had got on the ship and whether they were male or female and deduced who had
a higher chance of surviving.
